const tfe = `<p class="info">The Ferrari Challenge debuted in 1993 and at that time included just an Italian and European series. The 348 Challenge was the car that launched the event. The model was derived directly from the 348 TB. Only very few changes were made to the original car, in fact: the 348 Challenge had a more powerful 320 hp engine (+20 hp), a different exhaust system, slick tyres, modified brakes and specific dynamic air intakes. Naturally the 348 Challenges were also equipped with the regulation racing safety kit that included a roll cage, six-point harness, fire extinguisher, front tow hook and electric circuit breaker.</p>`;
const tff = `<p class="info">The F355 Challenge flanked the 348 Challenge in the Ferrari Challenge for the 1995 season. After the European series was launched in 1993 and followed by the North American one in 1994, 1995 brought a Japanese series too. Like the model it was chosen to replace the F355 Challenge was directly derived from its road-going berlinetta namesake. Once again, the engine was strictly a production one and the very limited modifications were confined to the exhaust system, the clutch, the slick tyres and obligatory racing safety equipment (roll cage, six-point safety harness, fire extinguisher, front two hook and electric circuit breaker). The F355 Challenge continued competing until 2000 when it was joined by the 360 Challenge which replaced it the following year.</p>`;
const ts = `<p class="info">Ferrari’s GT cars have always been highly competitive in the hands of privateers, and their racing achievements have played a fundamental role in the company’s motor sport history. That’s why the Ferrari Challenge one-make racing series was created – it was Ferrari’s way of getting owners of its road-going GT cars back on the track. The idea for a specific competition for the 8-cylinder cars first became reality back in 1993 with the 348 Berlinetta. In 1995 it was the turn of the F355, thanks to a special kit developed in-house by Ferrari. The 2000 season saw the debut of the 400-bhp, V8-engined 360 Modena Challenge alongside the F355. The 360 Modena maintains the same output (400 bhp @ 8,500 rpm) as the standard road car, but incorporates a number of modifications designed to radically improve its performance in track use.</p>`;
const ft = `<p class="info">The F430 Challenge, the 8-cylinder berlinetta-derived competition car that will be taking part in the Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli from the 2006 season. Ferrari has also reaffirmed the strong link between its GT and sporting divisions with the new F430 Challenge which is specifically designed to meet the expectations of its sportier clients.</p>`;
const ffe = `<p class="info">Following in the footsteps of the 348, the 355, the 360 and the F430, the 458 Challenge  is the fifth model fielded by Ferrari for the one-make Ferrari Challenge Trofeo Pirelli championship it organises for its sportier clients. Compared to the 458 Italia, the direct injection 4499 cc V8 remains strictly in production tune, with an output of 570 hp at 9,000 rpm. That said, modifications have been made to the gear ratios and calibration of its dual-clutch F1 gearbox to guarantee higher torque at lower revs. The 458 Challenge is also equipped with the E-Diff electronic differential already employed on the road-going version, a first for Ferrari’s track-only cars.</p>`;
const ffee = `<p class="info">458 Challenge Evo, compared to the 458 Challenge, has been boosted by the addition of an aerodynamic kit. It is powered by a 4.5 litre V8 engine capable of 570 horsepower but several updates have also improved handling. The most striking change is the rear wing that looks like the one used in GT competitions. It provides a lot more downforce for much better cornering. Then there are also a new front splitter and an even better designed underbody, which have allowed the Ferrari engineers to fit stiffer front springs and improve the braking system.</p>`;
